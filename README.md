## 😤 The Problem

If you've ever been in a bootcamp team project, you know this pain:

- Merge conflicts that wipe out **2.5 days** of work
- Everyone uses different folder structures and variable naming conventions
- No clear role assignments → one person does everything
- Starting from scratch every single time

---

Set up your entire dev team collaboration in under **5 minutes**.

## 💡 Origin Story

This project was born from a real experience — losing **2.5 days** to a merge conflict in a bootcamp team project because nobody agreed on folder structure or naming conventions from the start.

Quzz exists so that never happens to you.
